# Hello World 

First impressions on Scala with this program.
Learned, mostly, the burocracy involved during the execution of a few lines of code. 

## Key Take Always

1) Use Linux
2) SBT is important. It's similar to Maven. As far as I can tell, This is the application that will allow running your code on development environment (and without compile).
   1) Inside the file `build.sbt` there is a lot of possibilities and it's important to keep your project up with the dependecies needed.
3) To use VsCode as your development environment, make sure you have Metals extension installed
